      <p>The Right to Bear Farms is just a placeholder name for now. We intend to choose our name and brand style in the
        coming months.</p>

      <p>What we're here to do is help you firewall yourself from the world. We mean providing information that is
        crucial, genuine, actionable, and distinct from the generalized content typical of self-help channels. We're
        working on various businesses, products, services, ideas, and research and development, all with the common
        theme that they can be sold globally and online. Not only do we show you what we're doing, but we also invite
        you to get involved in these projects directly.</p>

      <p>We're a private, invite-only members club. To become a member, you first have to become a follower, engage with
        us, learn about what we do, and see if we're useful to you. If you find our information, products, services, and
        locations beneficial, then you may want to consider a premium subscription.</p>

      <p>The core team: Anybody who can bring complementary skills, capital, and resources, and who has the right
        mindset
        and character, can join the core team. Typically, we'll want to get to know you over at least six months, maybe
        longer. This will also depend on your proven track record and experience.</p>

      <p>All people in our organization are expected to have good character. Once we get to know you, we will explain
        exactly what that means.</p>

      <p>Paid subscribers get access to premium information. In other words, more fine detail as to what we're doing and
        how we're doing it, along with early access to our projects.</p>

      <p>Followers can join us for free through our content. This is how you get to know us. Once you feel comfortable
        with the value you're getting, please upgrade to a small paid subscription.</p>

      <p>Some of the subjects and sectors we're focused on are independent living off-grid, growing your own food and
        automated farming, security, privacy, sound money, healthcare, personal wellbeing, diet and more.</p>

      <p>We have one physical base in Eastern Europe, and we're also in contact with asssociates in Asia and South
        America for a secondary backup plan bases.</p>

      <p>All followers and paid subscribers will be updated regularly through our email list or whichever method you
        prefer to stay informed.</p>
